# This is a project about the coffee sales.
I used excel for my source data and used various functions such as Xlookup, logical IF, index and match functions in this project. The sales dashboard shows the coffee sales in various countries, top 5 customers contributing to the sales and flavours of coffee sold most over the chosen time period.
